This is the kind of advice I would have loved when I began my PhD in theoretical physics. Wait,
scrape that. This is the kind of advice I would have loved when I began studying Physics, some 10
years ago.

When I say "Be social", you may think that I was (or am) some kind of [Sheldon] from [TBBT], or
worse. Nothing more removed from the truth. I had tons of friends in and outside Physics, in and
outside university, I was a quite successful athlete and girls liked me. But once I proceeded in my
Bachelor, that attitude didn't translate in the academic world. When I moved to the Netherlands and
began my Master there, things didn't change much. Let me explain then what I meant by "Be social".

Physicists are usually a bunch of smart guys. We tend to trust our fellows because we know that, in
order to know what they know or be where they have, at least in part, to be like us.[^1]

[Sheldon]
[TBBT]
[^1]: This always gives me problems when evaluating candidates at work. If they're also
(Theoretical) Physicists, I immediately become biased.
