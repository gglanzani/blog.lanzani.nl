One of the gripes I have with [Helix] is not having automatic list continuation when writing Markdown.

Until last week, when I found out that there's a clever [trick] to achieve it, namely adding this to `~/.config/helix/languages.toml`

{{< highlight toml >}}
[[language]]
name = "markdown"
comment-tokens = ["-", "+", "*", "1.", ">", "- [ ]"]
{{< /highlight >}}

Note that when you have an ordered list, the trick will put the same number (e.g., **1.**) on each line. That's not a problem though because they will still be rendered properly with ascending numbers.
