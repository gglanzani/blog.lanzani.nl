[Ben Brooks](http://brooksreview.net/2011buy-first/) asks: if you would have to rebuy all of your software, which would be the order of buying? Here's mine

+ [Mathematica](http://wolfram.com) This is what I need for work. Without Dropbox, I'd sync with [unison](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/).
+ [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) 
+ [Papers](http://mekentosj.com/papers) To manage my papers collection. This would be a good moment to buy version 2.
+ [1Password](http://agilewebsolutions.com/onepassword) 
+ [Launchbar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) 
+ [Delibar](www.delibarapp.com ) To manage my [pinboard](http://pinboard.in) bookmarks
+ [Quickcursor](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/quickcursor) To edit any text field with Emacs.
+ [Flow](http://fivedetails.com/flow/ ) Yeah, I don't use Transmit
+ [Lightroom](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom/) I'm still stuck at version 2 though. Good enough for me.
+ [Graphclick](http://www.arizona-software.ch/graphclick/) Again, I use it for work, but not as much as Mathematica
+ [Find any file](http://apps.tempel.org/FindAnyFile/index.php ) Cheap, but incredibly useful and well done.
+ Adobe Creative Suite. I can buy this for 30$ through my university (yep, no typo), and I use Illustrator all the time.
+ Office. I don't link to it, but that's what I use to prepare my talks.
 
So... how would I do all my writing then, including this very blog post? [Emacs](http://emacsformacosx.com/) (part of Mac OS X as well).
