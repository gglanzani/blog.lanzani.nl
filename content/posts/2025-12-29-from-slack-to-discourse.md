> We’re moving from Slack to here. This way we can use an open source app that’s part of the open web — and we can have conversations that don’t get deleted, that are findable, that people can benefit from long after the conversation actually happened.

👏🏼 I would love if more communities were to move to Discourse.

We briefly had it for the GoDataDriven Academy, but it never took off with students. I guess they were not so idealistic?
