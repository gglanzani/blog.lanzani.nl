Depends on what you think about this snippet of code:[^1]
{{< highlight haskell >}}
let square y = y * y; limit = 100 in [(x, y, z) | y <- [1..limit], x <- [1..y], z <- [1..limit],  square x + square y == square z]
{{< / highlight >}}

[^1]: It finds all the right triangles with integer sides smaller than `limit` without duplicates. If you want the version with duplicates, just use `x <- [1..limit]`
