Superb article by the Economist on the success of super-strict classrooms in Britain.

The fascinating points:

- Pupils work hard, and they're not only OK with it, but it motivates them to aim high
- A strict classroom helps pupils from poorer families as children perceive discipline as safety and a promise of success (safety that they might lack at home or in other schools)
- Speaking of success, the school weaponizes praise, and children strive for merit points. Competition is not only biologically embedded but also raises everyone's grades as the school is among the best in Britain.
- Poetry is embedded in the school, with lunchtime poetry recitals:

> A young teacher stands at the front and shouts the first word of each line; the pupils respond with the rest.
