I forgot to link to this very good [article] from [David]. Having almost 6 kids, I am usually not
bothered by noise outside my head, but by noise inside my head.

Noise inside my head comes mostly from not having a long or well defined task. These are the kind
of tasks that tends to come in through Slack[^1].

To fix it I offload most of these tasks — *before* they reach me — to people who are
better at handling them.

Companies that are business-savvy about the hidden costs of interruptions should know that they
should be penny foolish and pound wise on this one.

[^1]: Instant messaging in general: I have nothing against the company besides creating a Mac application that loves to eat all my resources and that doesn't feel Mac-like.
