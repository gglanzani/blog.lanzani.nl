As announced (you heard it [here] first!) I talked at [PyData] Berlin 2014. You can find the
slides at [Speakerdeck] and a video of the presentation on [Youtube]. The video seems to be rather
popular on the PyData Youtube [channel], but we'll see if it'll stand the test of time.

Kudos to [Numfocus] and [Pydata] for promoting the conference and kudos to the organisation for
putting the video's online in record time (faster than WWDC's video's).
