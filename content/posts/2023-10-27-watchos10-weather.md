I've been bitten by [this] bug since getting a new Apple Watch.

Unfortunately, I had to revert to resetting all my location and privacy data on my iPhone, meaning I'm now continuously prompted by  iOS if I give permission to all my apps for location, camera, bluetooth, and what not.

I wished I had waited, though. watchOS 10.1 [fixes] this bug.
