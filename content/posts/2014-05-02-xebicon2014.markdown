In case you're in the Netherlands (or nearby! Hello Belgians), and are interested in big data and
data science, software development, continuous integration or architecture, then you should come to
[Xebicon] 2014. At €95 it is dirty cheap (you get good food too!) but if you're a swell chap I have
a promo code for you (just drop me a [line] and you'll get the early bird price).

Some highlights from the sessions:

+ The plenary is with [André Kuipers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/André_Kuipers), speaking about
  innovation; André is one of the first Dutch astronauts;
+ [Understanding natural language with 1500-year-old math][NL]: Jonatan, a colleague of mine, tries
  to classify the questions that you can type in a search box. He uses Stackoverflow data to train
  his classifier;
+ [iOS: Full speed ahead in your pants (Performance tuning on iOS)][iOS]: Jeroen will help the
  audience understand and analyze one of the most difficult, but most important, topic of mobile
  development: performance!
+ [Data: not as though as you think][data]: Big data, Machine Learning, real-time processing and
  predictive analytics: reserved for the data caste or something for everybody? Listen to the CTO
  of [GoDataDriven] share his knowledge.
