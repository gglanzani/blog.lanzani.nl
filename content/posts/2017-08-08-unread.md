I always hoped [app.net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App.net) would have become a new Twitter.

Not only was it friendlier than Twitter towards developers and users, but I was delighted every
time I had to interact with it: I was using [Riposte]. If you followed the previous link I can tell
you that I share Manton's opinion:

> *Riposte is arguably the best social networking client out there.*

The developer behind Riposte, [Jared Sinclair](http://jaredsinclair.com/) also developed another
delightful app: [Unread], a beautiful RSS reader for iPhone and iPad.

Unread, luckily, didn't end up the way Riposte did. It was acquired by [Supertop], but, due to the
success of Supertop's other app, [Castro], it did not get the attention it deserved.

I was therefore delighted and scared when Supertop announced that they [sold] Unread to
[Golden Hill Software](https://goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/). Delighted because the new owner has
more time to work on it, and scared as what change is always scary.

Being scared turned out not to be such a unjustified feeling: the 1.7 version broke my set up with
[Stringer], a self-hosted, anti-social RSS reader[^1].

Basically [Stringer] offers a [Fever]-compatible API. The new version of Unread tried to do some
smart things with the API, that Stringer was not offering.

I immediately wrote to John, Golden Hill Software's owner. He quickly replied that he would look
into it.

A few days later a new version of Unread came out but, alas, no fix for my issue.

I was kinda disappointed. I had to wait for the next release.

But no. John wrote me saying he pushed a [PR] to Stringer fixing the issue.

What a great developer! If you're on iOS, please give it a spin. As a bonus, the newest version
merges the iPhone and iPad version, which is timely as I realized some months ago that
Mr. Reader, my favorite iPad RSS reader, was not developed anymore.

So give it a go, and support a great developer!

[^1]: I don't think anyone is surprised when I characterize myself as anti-social.
