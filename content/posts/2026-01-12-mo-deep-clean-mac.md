  I just stumbled upon Mole, a utility to clean and optimize Macs. What stood out to me is fact that it packs a bunch of GUI utilities (DaisyDisk, iStat, AppCleaner etc.) into a neat TUI.

I just stumbled upon Mole, a utility to clean and optimize Macs. What stood out to me is fact that it packs a bunch of GUI utilities (DaisyDisk, iStat, etc.) into a neat TUI.

The developer has received quite some [scrutiny](https://x.com/HiTw93/status/2009628868207095948) being Chinese but that didn't stop a thriving community (+30 contributors) and user base (+28k ⭐️, +80 👀) to start using it.

Its core features are:

- 🪥 **Deep Cleaning**, removing logs, caches, and browser leftovers
- 📲 **Smart Uninstaller**, including launch agents, preferences, and hidden scraps
- 🔎 **Disk Insights**, visualizing usage and allowing managing large files
- 📊 **Live Monitoring**, for CPU, GPU, memory, dis, and network

While designed for macOS, there's a Windows branch in the [making](https://github.com/tw93/Mole/tree/windows).
