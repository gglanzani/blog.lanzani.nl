A la [Brett Terpstra][brett], a short list of links I've bookmarked this week

+ [Neovim]: vim's rebirth for the 21st century. An ambitious project by Thiago
  de Arruda to bring vim to the 21st century.
+ [Get started with rvm][RVM]: this was a better introduction to RVM and
  gemsets any documentation I've ever read on the [RVM website][rvmweb]. Highly
  recommended!
+ [Tabula]: If you’ve ever tried to do anything with data provided to you in
  PDFs, you know how painful this is — you can’t easily copy-and-paste rows of
  data out of PDF files. Tabula allows you to extract that data in CSV format,
  through a simple interface, running, if desired, locally.
+ [Two factor auth list][2FA]: List of websites and whether or not they support
  2FA. I've activated [two factor authentication][2FAwiki] on [Gandi] — which is a new feature, I guess.
+ [OneNote]: the premium note taking application from Microsoft has gone free
  and multiplatform. I've tried the Mac version, and I have to confess that,
  for being a 1.0, I'm impressed!
