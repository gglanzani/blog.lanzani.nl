title: Start using ddclient
snippet: |
   For more than 10 years, I've been a happy client of Tweak. One of the many features it offered was a fixed IP address. I recently had to switch provider to one not providing a fixed IP address.

   How could I work around it?

For more than 10 years, I've been a happy client of [Tweak] (how long will that link work?). One of the many features it offered was a fixed IP address. 

Now that I'm forced to switch to [Odido], I will lose this affordance, which serves me greatly whenever I need to connect to my VPN at home. In fact, my phone and laptop are configured to just connect to a subdomain of *lanzani.nl*, which pointed to my home address, and that address never changed. 

I then started looking for ways to update my IP address automatically. Luckily, there seems to be a service that's been designed for this, [ddclient] that I've set up in my home server as follows:

- First of all, as my DNS is managed by [Porkbun], I have to [enable API access](https://kb.porkbun.com/article/190-getting-started-with-the-porkbun-api) to change DNS parameters programatically;
- Configuring it is as easy as writing in `~/code/ddclient` the following

{{< highlight nginx >}}
# ddclient.conf
daemon=600
use=web
protocol=porkbun
apikey=APIKey
secretapikey=SecretAPIKey
subdomain.lanzani.nl
{{< / highlight >}}

- Then, as I don't want to install Perl and what not, I decided to leverage docker to run the script. The `yaml` for `docker-compose` couldn't be easier:

{{< highlight yaml >}}
services:
  ddclient:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/ddclient:latest
    container_name: ddclient
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
    volumes:
      - /path/to/code/ddclient:/config
    restart: unless-stopped
{{< / highlight >}}

- Start the service and see the logs coming in 

{{< highlight nginx >}}

That's it. Just a few lines of code, and the problem is gone!
