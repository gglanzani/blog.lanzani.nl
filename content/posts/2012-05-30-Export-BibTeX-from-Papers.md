title: Export to BibTeX from Papers (2)

If you always wanted to automate the tedious process of exporting your
collection of papers in [Papers][pap] to [BibTeX][bib] here's an Applescript
that does that:

{% gist 8471281 save_bib.scpt %}

To use it, you should invoke it when the focus on Papers is on the collection
(or selection of papers) that you want to export. The various variables
presented in the script, pretty self-explanatory, should allows for enough
customization.
