title: Mark Apple Music song as favorite in the background

I often listen to Apple Music in the background and sometimes I casually listen to a song I want to add to my favorites.

Instead of jumping around, I created a small AppleScript script (that can be executed through [Launchbar] or [Keyboard Maestro]).

I report it here for posterity!

{{< highlight applescript >}}
tell application "Music"
	set favorited of current track to true
end tell
{{< / highlight >}}
