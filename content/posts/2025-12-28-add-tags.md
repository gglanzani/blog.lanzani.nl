When starting this blog, I didn't think about adding tags. As time passed, I wondered about adding them, but back-filling them was a chore.

But with LLMs, this can be done relatively quickly and easily:

- Pass the LLM some text, and it will happily tell you which tags you might use.
- And, while you're at it, it can create the script to call the LLM on all the posts and the code to visualize tags (which were previously hidden).

So I did just that! In a 10-minute session, Copilot created the `add_tags.py` script, which you can find in [this](https://gist.github.com/gglanzani/e25a6d2faaa187859c577fd6267e0ce3) gist!

There are two commits where the tags were added: [one](https://github.com/gglanzani/blog.lanzani.nl/commit/2d5593f65c8fd1fe6bdb0262edf109dc01f00d81) for the theme and [the other](https://github.com/gglanzani/blog.lanzani.nl/commit/c60d9ad80988ef95393eeab10905c32d76ab0463) for adding the actual tags to the posts.
