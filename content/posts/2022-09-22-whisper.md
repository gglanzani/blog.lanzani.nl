[OpenAI] has just open sourced [Whisper], an automatic speech recognition.

I just tried it out and I'm blown away.

Installation was a piece of cake (even though there was a missing step, but I've opened a [pull request](https://github.com/openai/whisper/pull/30) to help out), and once you're there, it literally takes seconds to start transcribing:

```
whisper my_file.m4a --model base
```

The output is ready to be used in subtitles programs as well, as it looks like this

```
[01:23.000 --> 01:31.000] Camilla, first question, what keeps you awake at night?
[01:31.000 --> 01:36.000] Around data analytics, let's keep it to that box
[01:36.000 --> 01:45.000] Yeah, so I think we have three different, very specific business units
[01:45.000 --> 01:52.000] And we have teams that are divided between being masters in data in analytics
[01:52.000 --> 01:57.000] And they know much more than I do to having people who are just hearing about data
[01:57.000 --> 02:00.000] And it's a very, very scary topic
[02:00.000 --> 02:08.000] And what I'm supposed to be doing is raising the level so that we at least come to the same level of understanding
[02:08.000 --> 02:13.000] What does it mean for me? What does it mean for the company? What is data?
[02:13.000 --> 02:17.000] I mean we really go into those type of basic conversations
[02:17.000 --> 02:23.000] So that really is a challenge and an opportunity, huge opportunity
[02:23.000 --> 02:26.000] So that keeps me awake at night, how do I do that?
```

(The audio was taken from an [interview] I had with Camilla Bj√∂rkqvist last year).

The future is here :)
