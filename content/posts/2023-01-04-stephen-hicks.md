If you have 2 hours to spare, read [Nietzsche and the Nazis](https://www.stephenhicks.org/nietzsche-and-the-nazis/) by Stephen Hicks.

Fantastic, to-the-point, book about the philosophical ideals of the National Socialists. 

To quote just a single passage:

> History has taught us that the philosophy and ideals the Nazis stood for were and are false and terribly destructive, but we do not do ourselves any favors by writing the Nazis off as madmen or as an historical oddity that will never happen again. The Nazis stood for philosophical and political principles that appealed to millions—that attracted some of the best minds of their generation—and that still command the minds and hearts of people in all parts of the world.
>
> And that means we must face the National Socialists’ philosophical and political ideals for what they actually are—we must understand them, know where they came from, and what intellectual and emotional power they have. Then and only then are we in a position to defeat them. We will be able to defeat them because we will understand their power and we will have more powerful arguments with which to fight back.
