It has been almost two years since my last blog post. My new year resolution is
to not let that happen again.

I have some good reason for that though. Without any particular order:

+ I became father for the third time. Little Elena, as charming as she is,
  still keeps me awake more than needed (02);
+ I became a doctor in Theoretical Physics (02);
+ I finished my contract with [FOM](http://www.fom.nl) after four years of
  research (30);
+ I worked for a year at KPMG NL, as a consultant (01 -- 30/09/2013); I
  spontaneously left to become a
+ Data Whisperer at [GoDataDriven](http://www.godatadriven.com)
  (01 -- today). GoDataDriven is an amazing company, with a stellar
  [team of colleagues](http://www.godatadriven.com/team.html).

You may notice a pattern up there: end of September, begin October is always
busy.
