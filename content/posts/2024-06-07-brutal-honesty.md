Insightful linked post from John Gruber on why the AI pin flopped. This bit stood out to me as particularly insightful:

> It is the kiss of death for any endeavor, creative or technical, to have a culture where brutally honest internal criticism is not welcome, especially when it goes up the chain. In fact it needs to be the expectation, if youâ€™re pursuing excellence.
