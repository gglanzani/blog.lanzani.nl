Reading Simon Willison‘s excellent [blog](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/31/llms-in-2024/) on “Things we learned about LLMs in 2024”, made me realize why we’re not seeing much economic benefit[^1] from #llms yet.

What should we work on, then?

As it was always the case with AI, work on the pains and the gains of the end users and think about a UI and UX they can use and be more productive with!

Don’t expect them to change how they work simply because you turned on a feature on your Office or GitHub subscription!
