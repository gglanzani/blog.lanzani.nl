You would think nobody would ever never say something like that, but
[x0054](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7093910) disagrees. He
offers advice, (professional advice), on how not to get arrested. In case you
don't believe him, he links to some guy (a **Detective**) on youtube. This is
2014 folks!
