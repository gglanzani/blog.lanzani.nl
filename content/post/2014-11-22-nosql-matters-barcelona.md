title: My @NoSQLmatters Barcelona talk

It seems like, right now, I only write in this blog when a get a new child or when I speak at some
public event. Not breaking the tradition is this post, with the link to the slides accompanying the
talk.

As John Gruber aptly [put it](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/xoxo) (although for
another conference):

> Great crowd, great venue, and an amazing array of fellow speakers. It was a real honor and a
> thrill to speak [there].

I completely share John's take if I had to describe my experience at NoSQL matters Barcelona.

Without further ado,
[here's the link to the slides](https://speakerdeck.com/lanzani/real-time-data-driven-applications-and-sql-vs-nosql-databases-1).
