It took more than 9 months (9 months and four days to be precise), but Elia Lanzani is now here.
He's a healthy boy. He weights 3.8 kg and he seems like he could be a sleeper (I certainly hope so!).

The real hero is of course my wife that almost didn't blink while delivering. If before this I was
writing little here, rest assured I'll write even less now :)
