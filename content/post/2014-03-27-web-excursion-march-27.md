A short list of links I've bookmarked this week

+ [This is why OneNote is awesome][OneNote]: Maybe a bit over the top, but there are truly a lot of
  reason to use OneNote as your note taking app;
+ [kandan]: An Open Source Alternative to HipChat;
+ [CSS Diner][cssdiner]: CSS Diner is a little game to help you learn CSS selectors. Type in the
  correct selector to complete each level. So cool!
+ [Practical partitioning][partitioning]: A nice introduction to (MySQL) partitioning (in PDF);
+ [Using GNU Stow to manage your dotfiles][stow]: How to manage the various configuration files in
  your GNU/Linux home directory (aka "dotfiles" like .bashrc) using GNU Stow. I've immediately
  started using this. I might, one day, blog about it.
