I need to be on vacation in a house without internet connectivity[^1] to catch up with what is
happening on the web. So two months after Maciej Cegłowski gave a talk at Beyond Tellerand in
Düsseldorf, here am I, [linking] to it.

The talk is about the consequences of the internet on our lives. Maciej worked at Yahoo and runs a
profitable business selling something (almost) all his competitors are giving away for free so he's
no stupid and mostly knows what he's saying. As a bonus, his sense of humour is
almost unmatched on the web ([follow] him if you don't believe me).

If you're short on time (like me), at least read [it] up to the second animal picture. But you'll
miss gems like:

> You can dress up a bug and call it a feature. You can also put dog crap in the freezer and call
> it ice cream. But people can taste the difference.
