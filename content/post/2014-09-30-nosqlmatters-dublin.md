I was honored to have been invited at NoSQL matters Dublin 2014 as a speaker. The title of the talk
was *Real time data driven applications (and SQL vs NoSQL databases)* and being there was a great
pleasure.  Dublin is lovely, they have really good beer, the typical Irish breakfast charmed me and
beef had me yearning so good was it.

As a cherry on top of that, my wife flew with me, as we got married six years ago.

You can find the slides for the talk [here] in pdf and on [Speakerdeck]. I've even uploaded some
pictures to [Flickr].
