In the past few weeks I've written a couple of blog posts at the GoDataDriven blog:

+ [Convert chararray user ID's to integers with pig][pig]: here I explain how to use pig's `RANK`
  function;

+ [Merge Mahout output from different algorithms][mahout]: in this post I lay out a possible
  strategy to merge the output of different algorithms of Mahout item based collaborative filtering;

+ Last but not least, the [performance impact of vectorization][numpy] post covers how NumPy can
  efficiently compute operations on arrays.
